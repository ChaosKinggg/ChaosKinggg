## Hi, I’m Vedant 👋

I design and build **Embedded and Analog Hardware** — from schematics and PCB layout to in-house prototypes that are powered, tested, debugged, and iterated.
My work emphasis on learning through hands-on experimentation, where design choices face real-world constraints instead of simulations alone.

## Featured Projects
If you only have a few minutes, these best represent my work:

🔹 [**PMDC Motor Driver**](https://github.com/ChaosKinggg/Embedded-Hardware-Projects/tree/main/PMDC%20Motor%20Driver): Discrete NMOS motor driver with in-house prototypig and testing.

🔹 [**STM32F407-DISC Buffer Board RC-25**](https://github.com/ChaosKinggg/Robocon-2025-BRACTs-VIT-Pune-boards/tree/main/STM32F407-DISC%20Buffer%20Board%20RC-25): Interface and buffering board for STM32F407 DISC based control systems.
  
🔹 [**ESP32-C6 Dev Board**](https://github.com/ChaosKinggg/Embedded-Hardware-Projects/tree/main/ESP32-C6%20Dev%20Board): Custom MCU dev board for bring-up and firmware development.

Detailed schematics, layouts, and build notes are available in the pinned repositories below.
