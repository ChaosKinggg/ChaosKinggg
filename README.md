## Hi, I’m Vedant 👋

I design and build **Embedded and Analog Hardware** — from schematics and PCB layout to in-house prototypes that are powered, tested, debugged, and iterated.
My work emphasis on learning through hands-on experimentation, where design choices face real-world constraints instead of simulations alone.

## Featured Projects
If you only have a few minutes, these best represent my work:

- 🔹 **PMDC Motor Driver**  
  Discrete motor driver with in-house testing.
  
- 🔹 **ESP32-C6 Dev Board**  
  Custom MCU board for bring-up and firmware development.

- 🔹 **Robocon 2025 Hardware Boards**  
  Competition-used boards designed in Altium, iterated through in-house prototyping, and deployed during Robocon 2025.

Detailed schematics, layouts, and build notes are available in the pinned repositories below.

## 📦 Repositories
- **Personal Hardware Projects**  
  Self-driven embedded and hardware projects built purely for learning, experimentation, and skill development.

- **Robocon 2025 Hardware Boards**  
  Competition-deployed designs developed for BRACT’s VIT Pune during Robocon 2025.

📌 Both repositories are pinned below for easy access.
